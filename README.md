# jenca cloud

An easy way to run BIM applications in the cloud.

## Development

https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/kubernetes-on-vagrant.html

To develop Jenca cloud - you need to install VirtualBox ([version â‰¥5.0.6](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/14563)) and Vagrant.

Then you can use:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant$ cd /vagrant
vagrant$ make developer
```

To start the development environment.

### Tests

To run the tests in the Vagrant development environment, run:


```bash
vagrant$ make tests
```

### Contributing

Jenca cloud uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/jenca-cloud/jenca-cloud/) to run tests on each push of each branch.
We use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/clWQd0u9/jenca-cloud-development) to track progress on work.
To contribute to Jenca, create or find a Trello card, and create a branch with a name consisting of `issue-summary-<TRELLO-CARD-ID>`.
You can find the ID of a card by going to the card, choosing "Share and more..." and then selecting the final part of the link to the card.

Make changes on the branch and create a Pull Request in GitHub against `master`.
Only merge the branch into `master` once Travis reports that all tests have passed.

## Production

Spin up new server. See install.sh

Change IP in production.yml

then whilst SSH'd

```bash
$ make build
$ make prodrun
```

## Repos

Each service in jenca cloud uses it's own repository under the `jenca-cloud/` namespace.  This repo is the `glue` between all of these service repos.  In order to enable the repos to appear inside the development environment, the provisioning script will `git clone` the various repos inside the `repos` folder (which is git ignored).

This allows the development VM to see the various service repos and for the developer to still use their git credentials on the host to git commit/git push.

## Images

Each service will have a Makefile inside the repo that will have an `images` make step.  This will use `docker build` to create the jenca images from the various repos.  The `version` of these images is controlled by the VERSION variable at the top of each Makefile.
